</li><li><b>Put uboot on the mini2440</b><br>
By first downloading the s3c2410_boot_usb, and the u-boot-256M.bin 
files. 
Second, switch to NOR and reboot with minicom running.
In minicom, type 'v' to 'download vivi', and while the usb device-cable 
is connected, run in another terminal ./s3c2410_boot_usb u-boot-256M.bin<br>
Possibly chmod 755 s3c2410_boot_usb first.<br>
Now we have uboot on the NAND flash on our bord, we can test that by 
booting into NAND. However our work isn't done yet. The uboot-env 
partition isn't working and we don't have a bad block table on the NAND 
flash yet.
To put that on the NAND, we will have to erase uboot however. No, 
problem, after erasing it, we will put uboot back:<br>
nand scrub<br>
nand createbbt<br>
dynpart<br>
dynenv set u-boot_env<br>
reset<br>
Now we need to put u-boot back. So boot in NOR, in supervivi 'send vivi', ./s3c2410_boot_usb u-boot-256M.bin and boot in NAND.<br>
Also enable the u-boot_env parition back:<br>
dynpart<br>
dynenv set u-boot_env<br>
saveenv<br>
reset<br>
Now we test if uboot environment works in the u-boot prompt:<br>
setenv foo bar<br>
saveenv<br>
reset<br>
printenv<br>
If everything is ok, the foo=bar will be visible.<br><p>
</p></li><li><b>Booting from the network using TFTP and NFS</b>
Following the boot sequence, the following needs to be accomplished:<br>
Uboot needs to be configured to get an IP adres (dhcp) and get the linux
 kernel image over TFTP. For this we need a tftp server on our 
workstation.<br>
Then we also need to set in uboot the boot arguments for the kernel to 
use a NFS server as root filesystem. For that we need an nfs server on 
our workstation.<br>
The kernel also needs to be able to boot over nfs, so we need to change or verify the kernel configuration.<br>
So here are the commands (out of my head - might need some tweaking):<br>
On the workstation to install tftpd and nfs server:<br>
apt-get install nfs-kernel-server tftpd-hpa
<br>We need to put the uImage file in the /var/lib/tftpboot directory to
 be able to be transferred. It can be practical to test if the tftp 
server works by using a tftp client on our workstation and try to get 
uImage file locally to the /tmp directory:<br>
cp /usr/src/buildroot/output/images/uImage /var/lib/tftpboot
<br>cd /tmp
<br>tftp localhost
<br> get uImage
<br>ls
<br>If this works, we know the tftp server is ready to serve our kernel to the board.
<br>So let's put something on the NFS server first, we can export a 
directory with nfs in the /etc/exports file, add this line to it:
<br>/export/mini2440/ *(rw,no_root_squash)
<br>exportfs -a
<br>Be aware that we serve it to any IP on the network.
<br>mkdir /export/mini2440
<br>cp /usr/src/buildroot/output/images/rootfs.tar /export/mini2440/
<br>cd /export/mini2440/
<br>tar xvf rootfs.tar
<br>
<br>We could test out on a fellow student his or her laptop if the exported nfs is visible and if we can mount it.
<br>Or we could try it right away if we feel lucky :)
<br>
<br>How to try it? Look at our book for the exact nfs kernel arguments 
to be provided on page 295. The uboot environment variable for the tftp 
server is set in this way:<br>
In uboot we do:<br>
setenv bootargs root=/dev/nfs nfsroot=192.168.1.12:/export/mini2440 ip=dhcp console=ttySAC0,115200 <br>
setenv tftpip=192.168.1.12
<br>Where you provide the IP adres of your laptop instead of .12
<br>We can get an IP in uboot by doing dhcp:
<br>dhcp
<br>And get the uImage over tftp<br>
tftp 0x32000000 uImage
<br>Now you should see lots of #-signs to indicate the uImage file 
transfer. They might stutter over the wifi connection to your laptop.
<br>saveenv
<br>bootm 0x32000000
<br>If we don't get a kernel panic we have probably booted over nfs. Verify by doing df to check how much diskspace we have.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Verify if NFS root capabilities are part of the linux kernel:
<br>cd /usr/src/buildroot 
<br>make linux-menuconfig
<br>This is not the general buildroot menuconfig, but the menuconfig 
specific for the linux kernel. If we download the linux kernel outside 
of buildroot and run in the source directory 'make menuconfig ARCH=arm',
 we would get the same screen.
<br>Inside this menuconfig we are going to look for NFS root capability:
<br>Filesystems -- Network Filesystems -- Root Filesystem over NFS
<br>On the git version this is already enabled. If it would not be 
visible, it might be necessary to enable 'kernel IP configuration first.
 This is located on a completely different location:
<br>Networking Support -- Networking Options -- IP: Kernel level autoconfiguration
<br>Best to enable DHCP and BOOTP there (already the case on the git version of august 2013).
<br>otherwise, after making changes, run make again and use this newer kernel.
<br>
</li><li><b>Change the MAC address in uboot</b><br>
setenv ethaddr 01:02:03:04:05:06<br>
Please ensure you have a random or different mac address on your board 
than the other people on the network, otherwise switches get confused 
and you don't have a reliable network connection.<br>
</li><li><b>Touchscreen</b><br>
By default the screen brightness is turned off, turn it on with:<br>
echo 255 &gt; /sys/class/leds/backlight/brightness<br>
Look at this patch: <a href="https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/1169951/">https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/1169951/</a><br>
Or download 3.6.2 with ts capabilities <a href="http://linuxbe.com/emb/files/uImage-3.6.2-ts">here</a><br>Also add this kernel argument in uboot: mini2440=3tb<br>
And for the touchscreen interaction to work, we need to put some environmental variables too:<br>
<br>ln -s /dev/input/event0 /dev/ts
<br>export TSLIB_TSDEVICE=/dev/input/event0
<br>export TSLIB_CALIBFILE=/etc/pointercal
<br>export TSLIB_CONFFILE=/etc/ts.conf
<br>export QWS_MOUSE_PROTO=Tslib
<br>I like to use the fancybrowser app to connect to a web server running locally to create an interface written in php:
<br>/usr/share/qt/examples/webkit/fancybrowser/fancybrowser -qws 
-geometry 320x240+0+0 -decoration Default http://localhost/linux-php.php
 
<br>For this, I also run a patched version of fancybrowser without 
window dressing (done by stripping some code and creating a decoration 
with nothing:<br>
<a href="http://linuxbe.com/emb/files/fancybrowser.tgz">fancybrowser.tgz</a><br>
</li><li><b>Update uboot env from within Linux</b><br>
First we need to add the Uboot tools fw_printenv/fw_setenv in buildroot.<br>
Then we need a configuration file in Linux which explains how the internal NAND flash is partitioned.<br>
This file is called: /etc/fw_env.config<br>
Content should be in this format:<br>
/dev/mtd1 0x0 0x20000 0x20000<br>
If this is not correct, verify in uboot with dynpart what the offset of the partition is.
